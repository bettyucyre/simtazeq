# How to Get Unbanned on Smite (2025 Guide) 🎮

Getting banned from Smite can feel like getting sent to the Underworld — and not in a fun way. 😩 Whether you think it was a glitch or your Mischief God antics went too far, this simple guide will walk you through what to do if you’ve been banned and how to appeal your ban so you can get back to smashing gods and grinding Conquest.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did you get banned straight after making a fresh account? Or can’t even start the game on multiple accounts? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! This means Smite has flagged your PC hardware, making it tricky to dodge bans just by creating new profiles.

- Using hacks, cheats, or unfair third-party tools  
- Toxic in-game behavior or harassment  
- Account sharing or suspicious login activity  

**Pro tip:** Always skim through the Hi-Rez Terms of Service before firing off an appeal.
